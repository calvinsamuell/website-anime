            The seemingly unimpressive Saitama has a rather unique hobby: being
            a hero. In order to pursue his childhood dream, Saitama relentlessly
            trained for three years, losing all of his hair in the process. Now,
            Saitama is so powerful, he can defeat any enemy with just one punch.
            However, having no one capable of matching his strength has led
            Saitama to an unexpected problemâ€”he is no longer able to enjoy the
            thrill of battling and has become quite bored. One day, Saitama
            catches the attention of 19-year-old cyborg Genos, who witnesses his
            power and wishes to become Saitama's disciple. Genos proposes that
            the two join the Hero Association in order to become certified
            heroes that will be recognized for their positive contributions to
            society. Saitama, who is shocked that no one knows who he is,
            quickly agrees. Meeting new allies and taking on new foes, Saitama
            embarks on a new journey as a member of the Hero Association to
            experience the excitement of battle he once felt.
